# SnakeAI
SnakeAI is a package developed to provide an interactive tool for training neural networks in mastering the Snake game, using a genetic algorithm for the training

The main functionality is:

- Play against one of the trained models
- Observe a model playing while showing the neural network responding to inputs
- Train new models by selecting the neural network architecture and configuration, as well as the genetic algorithm
- Generate statistics over the different trained models and compare them graphically
<br>

## Dependencies
This project make use of the following third-party libraries:

- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Pygame
- Customtkinter
<br>

## Main menu
Once the app is started it will prompt the main manu, the different options correspond to those described above

## Play vs AI
Under this section we can play against one of the trained models, as well as configure some of the game setting as graphics interface, speed, grid size..

## Test Model
In this section we can test our trained models and see the strongest activations over the neural network. During this execution the app produces son statistical data about the model that can be used to be compared with other models
