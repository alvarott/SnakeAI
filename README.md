# SnakeAI
SnakeAI is a package that allows you to experiment with different tuning combinations while training a neural network using a genetic algorithm to play the video game Snake

The main functionality is:

- Play against one of the trained models
- Observe a model playing while showing the neural network responding to inputs
- Train new models by selecting the neural network architecture and configuration, as well as the genetic algorithm
- Generate statistics over the different trained models and compare them graphically
